## Chapter 12 Modeling With System of Different Equations


### 12.1 Graphical Solutions of the Autonomous System of First-order Differential

Page 529: #1, #6

In Problems 1-4, verify that the given function pair is a solution to the first-order system.

1.$x = -e^{t}$  $y = e^{t}$

$\frac{dy}{dt}=x$ $\frac{dx}{dt}=y$

**Prove:**

Differentiation of x gives us:

$x' = -e^{t} = y$ 

Differentiation of y gives us:

$y' = e^{t} = x$ 

So
$x = -e^{t}$ and $y = e^{t}$ is the solution to the first-order system $\frac{dy}{dt}=x$ $\frac{dx}{dt}=y$

In Problems 5-8, find and classify the rest points of the given autonomous system.

6. $\frac{dx}{dt}=-(y-1)$ $\frac{dy}{dt}= x-2$

**Solution:**

If simultaneously $\frac{dx}{dt}=-(y-1) = 0$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}= x-2 = 0$. Thus (x= 2, y=1), is the rest point of the system.

Use the Substitution Method to find the solution for the first-order syste.

$x'=1-y, x''=-y'= -x+2$ $x''+x=2$ 

$y'=x-2, y''=-x'= 1-y$  $y''+y=1$ 

$x'=a_{11}x+a_{12}y+b_1, a_{11}= 0, a_{12}=-1,b_1=1$ 

$x'=a_{21}x+a_{22}y+b_2, a_{11}= 1, a_{12}=0,b_2=-2$ 

Solve the homogeneous part:

$x^h(t)=c_1e^{r_1t}+c_2e^{r_2t}$ 

$y^h(t)=-r_1c_1e^{r_1t}-r_2c_2e^{r_2t}$ 

Solve the steady-state part:

$\overline{x}=\frac{a_{12}b_2 - a_{22}b_1}{a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21}}$

$\overline{x}= \frac{(-1)\times(-2)-0}{-(-1)\times 1} = 2$

$\overline{y}=\frac{a_{21}b_2 - a_{11}b_1}{a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21}}$

$\overline{y}=\frac{1\times 1-0}{0-(-1)\times 1} = 1$

If $x''+a_1x-2=0$, r_1,r_2 could be expressed as:

$r_1,r_2 = \frac{- a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^2-4a_2}}{2}$ 

$a_1^2 =0, 4a_2=4$ 

So 

$a_1^2 < 4a_2$

So $r_1 and r_2 $ have Complex Roots & $r_1 \neq r_2$ 

$r_1,r_2 = \pm i$ 

In the case when$ r_1 and r_2$ have complex Roots &$r_1 \neq r_2$, if the real part of roots h < 0, the steady state is stable. But now h = 0, so the steady state is unstable. In the other word, The rest point is unstable.

7. Show that the two trajectories leading to (m=n, a=b/ shown in Figure 12.8 are unique.

a. From system (12.6) derive the following equation:

$\frac{dx}{dy}=\frac{(m-nx)y}{(a-by)x}$

b. Separate variables, integrate, and exponentiate to obtain

$y^ae^{-by}=Kx^me^{-nx}$

where K is a constant of integration.

c. Let $f(y)= y^a/e^{by}$ . Show that f(y) has a unique maximum of
$M_y = (a/eb)^a $ when y = a/b as shown in Figure 12.12. Similarly, show that g(x)
has a unique maximum $M_x = (x/en)^m $ when x= m/n, also shown in Figure 12.12.

**Solution:**
